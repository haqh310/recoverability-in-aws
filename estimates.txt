1.Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    Allow for quick switching to the standby instance in another AZ, ensuring minimal downtime.
2.Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    Minimum RTO can extend to approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours. In the time, possibly initiate recovery procedures in the standby region, which may involve additional steps compared to an AZ failover.
3.Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    Replication of data to the standby instance in another AZ, which ensures that no data is lost during the failover process.
4.Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    The minimum RPO can range from 10 minutes to several hours. Data replication to the standby region may not be synchronous, depending on the configuration, and there may be a lag in data updates during the transition to the backup region.
